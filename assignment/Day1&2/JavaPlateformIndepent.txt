Q- How java managed to be platform-independent explain?
The meaning of platform-independent is that the java compiled code(byte code) can run on all operating systems.
A program is written in a language that is a human-readable language. 
It may contain words, phrases, etc which the machine does not understand. 
For the source code to be understood by the machine, it needs to be in a language understood by machines,typically a machine-level language.
So, here comes the role of a compiler. The compiler converts the high-level language (human language) into a format understood by the machines.
 Therefore, a compiler is a program that translates the source code for another program from a programming language into executable code.
